Certainly! Here are concise points on various examples of security defects:

1. **SQL Injection**
   - Attackers inject malicious SQL code via input fields, manipulating or accessing data unauthorizedly.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Malicious scripts are injected into web pages, potentially hijacking user sessions or redirecting users to malicious sites.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Users are tricked into performing actions they didn't intend, such as changing settings or transferring funds, without their knowledge.

4. **Buffer Overflow**
   - Data exceeds the allocated buffer memory, leading to arbitrary code execution or system crashes.

5. **Insecure Cryptographic Storage**
   - Sensitive data is stored inadequately without proper encryption, making it vulnerable to theft.

6. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
   - Attackers access objects directly by modifying a parameter value, exploiting insufficient authorization checks.

7. **Broken Authentication**
   - Flaws in authentication mechanisms allow attackers to assume other users' identities or compromise authentication tokens.

These points highlight critical areas where security can be breached due to software defects.
