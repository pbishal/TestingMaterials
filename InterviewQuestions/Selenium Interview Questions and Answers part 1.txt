Selenium Interview Questions and Answers

1.What is automation testing and benefits?
Test automation is a process that makes use of automation testing tools to execute pre-scripted tests on applications, then compares the test results to the expected behavior and reports it to the testers.

Benefits:

----------

It executes tasks automatically.
Increases effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of the software testing.

2.Why should Selenium be selected as a test tool?
Selenium is an open source automation testing tool which is used to test web applications.
Selenium testing tool consists of different set of tools in it like Selenium WebDriver, Selenium RC, Selenium IDE
which has different features.

Selenium IDE
Selenium RC
Selenium Webdriver
Selenium Grid

4.What is the difference between Selenium RC and WebDriver?
Selenium RC:

----------------

It does not make direct calls to the browser.There will be an intermediate server.

9.What is a WebDriver ? Whether WebDriver is class or interface?
Webdriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests againts different browser,not just firefox.
Webdriver also enables you to use a programming language in creating your test script.
Webdriver is a interface.


10.What is the method name to launch the url?
get() method is used to lanuch the given url.


11.What are the method names are available to get the title and url of the webpage?
getTitle()- used to get the title of the webpage.

close():

--------

It will close the current window only.
quit():

-------

It will close all the opened windows and browser will also be closed.

13.What are the methods available in WebDriver?
close()
findElement()
findElements()
get()
getTitle()
getCurrentUrl()
manage()
quit()
switchTo()

14.What is the use of WebDriver?
It is mainly used for providing the connection between the browser and local system.
It acts as a bridge.

15.What are the locators available in selenium?
id
classname
name
Xpath
CSSselector
linkText
partialLinkText
tagname

16.Which locator is fastest in selenium?
id is the fastest locator in selenium.
17.How will you find the locators in selenium? write a code for it?
We can find the locator by using findElement() and findElements() methods.
Code

-------

driverrefname.findElement(By.locator("values");

18.Difference between findElement and FindElements?
findElement

------------

It is used to find only one webElement.
If no element is found it throws NoSuchElementException.
findElements

---------------

It is used to find a list of webElements.
findElements will return an empty list when no elements found

19.What is the return type of findElement and findElements?
findElement - WebElement
findElements - List<WebElement>

20.In which class all the locator methods are available?
*By is an abstract class in which all the locator methods are available.

21.What is the method used to insert value in a textbox?
sendKeys() method is used to insert value into a textbox.

22.Write a code for inserting value in textbox?

WebElementRefname.sendKeys("values to be inserted");

23.When multiple WebElements has same Xpath,how we can find it uniquely?
*When multiple WebElements has same Xpath,we can give index for that to uniquely locate a WebElement.

Index starts from 1 to n

*syntax: (xpath)[index]

24.How will you click a button in webpage?
*By using click() method we can click a button in webpage.

25.Whether WebElement is a interface or class?
*WebElement is an interface.

26.What is mean by System.setProperty?
System is a class and setProperty is a method which accepts 2 arguments i.e key and path
Key represents in which browser we are going to test the application
path defines the location of driver executable file.
It is used to set the class and path location of driver.

27.What is Xpath? Why we are going for Xpath?
Xpath is one of the locator available in Selenium.
Reason for going to Xpath:

---------------------------

For validating the locator.

When id,classname,name is not present,we go for Xpath.
28.What are the Types of Xpath?
Absolute Xpath
Relative Xpath
29.What is the difference between Absolute Xpath and Realtive Xpath?
Absolute Xpath:

---------------

It contains \
Here we find path from root element <html> to desired WebElement tagname
Relative Xpath:

---------------

It contains \\
Here we find the path from the desired WebElement's tagname only
30.What are the difference between / and // ?
\:

---

It means absolute Xpath
It is used to find path from root element <html> tagname to desired WebElement tagname
\\:

----

*It means Relative Xpath \\
*Using this,we find the path from the desired WebElement's tagname only
31.What is the difference between CSS selector and Xpath?
Xpath:

--------

Xpath syntax is complex compared to css selector
Using Xpath,we can validate the locators.
Xpath becomes inconsistent in some browsers
We can traverse both forward and backward direction
CSS selector:

---------------

CSS selector has simple syntax and it is faster than xpath.
CSS selector traverse only in forward direction.
32.What is the difference between Radio and CheckBox button?
Radio button:

--------------

For radio button we have to select atleast one option.
For deselecting we have to select the another option present.
Check box:

------------

In checkboxes,we can select more than one option.
For deselecting we have to select the same option one more time.

33.What is the syntax used to perform click operation using JavaScriptExecutor?
JavaScriptExecutor is an interface that helps to execute JavaScript through Selenium WebDriver.
To perform click operation:

------------------------------

JavaScriptExecutor js=(JavaScriptExecutor)driverRef;
js.executeScript("arguments[0].click()",webElementRef);
34.What are the Xpath functions available?
text()
contains()
starts-with()

35.How will you select a female Radio Button in facebook signup and write a code for it ?
*WebElement radioGender=driverRef.findElement(By.Xpath
("//input[@value='1']");

radioGender.click();

36.Baseclass method for clicking an WebElement
*Public static void btnClick(WebElement element){

element.click();

}

37.What is mean by StaleElementReferenceException?
Stale Element means an old element or element that is no longer available in DOM.
When the user refreshes the page or navigates into new page, DOM changes then the WebElement goes stale.
If we try to reuse the WebElement that became stale we will get StaleElementReferenceException.
To avoid this exception, we can implement POM framework.

38.What is the purpose of debug?
It is used to find the error in the program code.
It is the step by step verification.
We can easily identify the step where the code getting exception.
39.What are the steps to be debug?
Set the break point
just right click-->debug us-->java application.
Click the shortcut key F6 for stepOver(for moving each step)
40.What are the ways to do debug?
Eclipse debugger.
Firefox javaScript debugger.
Dynamic debugging technique
On line debugging tool.
41.How to find xpath for any WebElement which contains no attributes?
By using xpath function text() and contains()
//tagname[text()='textname']

//tagname[contains(text(),'partial text')]

42.How to print a paragraph from webpage?
By using xpath function text(),contains()
//tagname[contains(text(),'partial text')]

By using getText() method we can get the text
System.out.Println(webElemRef.getText();)

43.What is the method used to get the text from the webpage?
getText() method is used to get the text from webpage.
44.What is the purpose of getText() and getAttribute() ?
getText() method is used to get the text from webpage.
getAttribute("attributename") method is used to get the attribute value of the given attribute
getAttribute("value") also used to get the input what we have passed to a webElement
45.What is the return type of getText() and getAttribute() ?
String is return type for both the methods.
46.In which class/interface  getText() and getAttribute() methods present ?
In WebElement interface ,getText() and getAttribute() methods are present
47.What is the use of Thread.sleep(milliseconds)?
Thread.sleep(milliseconds) is used to make your program to wait for some defined time to avoid abnormal termination due to page loading issues.
48.Whether it is possible to get the text from webpage without using getText()?
No,it is not possible to get the text from webpage without using getText() method.
49.What is Mouse hover action?
To move the cursor over a desired WebElement.
When we place cursor over some content in the webpage,it will display a list of content.For achieving those actions
we can use Actions class.
50.Write a code to perform MouseOverAction?
*Actions refName= new Actions(driver refName);

refName.moveToElement(WebElementrefName).perform();
