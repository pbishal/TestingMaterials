31.What is mean by string?
Collection of characters or words enclosed within double quotes is called as String.

String is a class in java
String is index based
Example : "greenstechnology".

32.What are the method available in string?
equals();
equalsignorecase();
contains();
split();
toUpperCase();
toLowerCase();
subString();
isEmpty();
identifyHashCode();
startsWith();
endsWith();
CompareTo();
charAt();
indexOf();
 lastIndexOf();
replace();
 
33.What is mean by constructor?
Constructor is a special method which is called by default when object is created for that particular class.(implicit call)
Class name and constructor name must be same.
It doesn't have any return type.
It supports method overloading but won't support method overriding.
purpose of constructor:It is used to initialise the values to variables.

34.Explain the types of constructor?
Parameterized constructor
Non parameterized constructor

35.Do constructors have any return type?
No,constructor can't have any return type.

36.Write a syntax for creating constructor?

Access specifier classname(){

}

37.What are the rules for defining a constructor?
Class name and constructor name must be same.
It should not have any return type.

38.Why a return type is not allowed for constructor?
constructor is not directly called by your code, its called by memory allocation and object initialisation in the run time.
Its return value is opaque to the user so we cant mention it.

39.Can we declare constructor as 'private'?
Yes,we can declare constructor as private.

40.Why a compiler given constructor is called as default constructor?
If we didnt create a constructor explictly it will take the default constructor.

41.What is constructor chaining and how can it be achieved in Java?
The process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object is called constructor chaining.
By using this() and super() methods we can achieve constructor chaining.

42.What are the difference between this() and super()?
this() is used to call class level constructor.
super() is used to call the parent class constructor.

43.What is the super class of all java?
Object is the super class of all classes in java.

44.What are the types of variable?
 Local level variable.
Global/Class level variable.
  Static variable.
Final variable

45.What is meant by local variable,instance variable,class/static variable?
Static Variable-It is shared by all the objects in the class. 
Local Variable-A variable declared inside a method/block.Level of access:only inside the block
Class variable-A variable declared outside all methods but inside class. Level of access is only with in object

46.What is mean by static keyword in java?
The static keyword is mainly used for memory management.
It is used to share the same variable or method by objects of given class.

47.Can we override static method in java?
No,we can't override the static method because it is part of a class rather than an object.

48.Can we overload static method in java?
Yes, we can overload the static method in java.

49.What is mean by static variable?
When a variable is declared as static,then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all object at class level.
Static variable are essentially global variable.
All the instance of the class share the same static variable.

50.What is mean by static method?
When a method is declared as static,we need not create object to call the paticular method.We can call as Classname.methodname()
Static method in java belong to the class(not to an object).
They use no instance variables and will usually take the input from the parameters and perform action on it,then return some result.

51.What is mean by final keyword and what's happend when we declare final as in class,method,variable?
Final is a non access modifier applicable to a variable, method or a class.
When a variable is declared with final keyword,its value can't be modified.
When a method is declared as final we can prevent method overriding.
When a class is declared as final we can prevent inheritance.

52.What is difference between final and finally keyword?

Final:
-----

Final varaible can't be modified.
Final method can't be overrided.
Final class can't be inherited.

Finally:
--------

 Code given inside finally block will always get executed whether exception occurs or not.

53.Where local,static and class variables stores in jvm?
Static variables are stored in the permGen section of heap memory.
Local variables are stored in stack.
Class variables are stored in heap memory.

54.What is Exception?
Exception is an unexpected event which when occurs in a program,your program will terminate abnormally.
We can avoid this abnormal termination using exception handling mechanisms(try,catch,finally,throw,throws)

55.Explain about types of Expection?
Unchecked exception(Run time exception)
Checked exception(Compile time exception)

56.What are the difference between checked expection and unchecked expection?

Unchecked exception:
-------------------------

It will occur at the Run time.
Checked exception:
----------------------

Checked exception will occur at the Compile time.

57.What is the super class for Exception and Error?
Throwable
Exception

58.Can we have try block without catch block?
Yes we can have try block without catch block.But in that case finally block must be present.(There will be no syntax error)
Possible but we will not able to handle the exception without catch block.
59.Can we write multiple catch blocks under single try block?
Yes,we write multiple catch blocks under single try block.
60.How to write user defined exception or custom exception in java?
First customised exception must come under Exception class.

access_specifier method_name() throws customException {
throw new customException();
}

61.What are the different ways to print exception message on console?
ref.printStackTrace() method is used to print the exception message in the console.
62.What are the differences between final finally and finalize in java?

Final:
-----

A final class variable whose value cannot be changed.
A final method is declared in class level, they cannot be inherited.
A class declared as final can't be inherited.
Finally:
--------

It’s a block of statement that definitely executes after the try catch block.
Exception occurs or not,finally block always get executed.
Finalize:
---------

It will clean up unused memory space.
63.What are the differences between throw and throws?

Throw:
------

Throw is a keyword, using which we can throw any any exception.This keyword always given inside the method.
At a time we can throw only one exception using throw keyword.

Throws:
---------

Throws is a keyword, it is used to handle the exception(given in method level).
we can handle more than one exception using throws keyword.
64.Explain Java Exception Hierarchy?

Exception

Unchecked exception(Run time exception)	Checked exception(Compile time exception)
ArithmeticException	IOException
NullPointerException	SQLException
InputMismatchException	FileNotFoundException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExcepion	ClassNotFoundException
StringIndexOutOfBoundExcepion
IndexOutOfBoundExcepion	 
NumberFormatException	 
65.What is mean by throw and throws?
Throw is a keyword,used to explicitly throw an exception
Throws is a keyword, it is used to handle the exceptions(in method level).

66.What is mean by array?
Storing multiple values of similar datatype in a single variable.
It is index based one.

67.What are the advantages and disadvantages of array?

Advantage:
-------------

In a single variable we can store multiple values.
Disadvantages:
----------------

It support only similar data types.
Size fixed at compile time.
Memory wastage is high.

68.Different ways to intialise array?
Datatype refName[]= new Datatype[size];
Datatype[] refname={ value1,value2,....};

69.Can we change the memory size of array after intialization?
No,we can't change the memory size of array after intialization.

70.What is collection ?
It will support storage of multiple values with dissimilar data types.
It is dynamic memory allocation.
No memory wastage like array.

71.What is the difference between ArrayList and Vector?

ArrayList:
----------

Asynchronized
It is not a thread safe

Vector:
-------

Synchronized
Thread safe

72.What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?

LinkedList:
-----------

Insertion and deletion is a best one.
Searching/retrieving is a worst.
It’s makes performance issue.
ArrayList:
----------

In Arraylist retrieve/searching is a best one
In ArrayList deletion and insertion is a worst one because if we delete/insert one index value after all the index move to forward/backward.
It makes performance issue.

73.Difference between Collection and Collections
Collection-Collection is an interface under which we have list,set,queue
Collections-is an utility class in which we have lots of predefined methods which we can apply over collection objects.
Eg:Collections.min(),Collections.max(),Collections.sort()

74.Describe the Collections type hierarchy ? What are the main interfaces ?

Collection:
------------

List
Set
Map----doesnt come under collection,it is a separate interface in java

Hierarchy:
-----------


List:
----

ArrayList
LinkedList
Vector

Set:
----

Hashset
LinkedHashSet
Treeset

Map:
----

HashMap
LinkedHashMap
Hashtable
TreeMap
ConcurrentHahMap

75.What is difference between set and List?
Set:
----

It is a value based one.
It prints in random order.
It won't allow duplicates.

List:
-----

It is a Index based one.
It prints in insertion order.
It allow duplicates.

76.What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet ? 

HashSet:
---------

It prints in random order.
TreeSet:
---------

Treeset prints in ascending order

77.How to convert List into Set?
By addAll() we can convert List into set.(all the elements in list will get added to set)

78.What is map?
It is key and value pair.
Here key+value is one entry.
Key ignore the duplicate value and value allow the duplicates.
79.What is difference between Hash Map and Hash Table?

HashMap:
----------

Key allows single null.
Asynchronised(not thread safe).

Hashtable:
----------

Key and value won't allow null.
Synchronised(thread safe).
80.What is difference between set and Map?

Set:
---- 

It is a value based one.
It print in random order.
It won't allow duplicates.

Map:
----

It is key and value pair.
Here key+value is one entry.
Key ignore the duplicate value and value allow the duplicates.
