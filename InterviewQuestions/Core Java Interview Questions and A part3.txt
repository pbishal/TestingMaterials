81.Can we iterator the list using normal for loop?
Yes,we can iterate the list using both normal and enhanced for loop.

82.What are the methods available in list But not in set?
indexOf();
get();
lastIndexOf();

83.Explain about user defined Map?
It is key and value pair.
Here key+value is one entry.
Key ignore the duplicate value and value allow the duplicates.

84.How much null allows in below maps:
HashMap :k?,v?
LinkedHashMap:k?,v?
TreeMap :k?,v?
HashTable :k?,v?
HashMap :k-1 null,v- n null
LinkedHashMap:k-1 null,v- n null
TreeMap :k-ignore null,v- allow null
HashTable :k-ignore null,v- ignore null

85.How to Iterate Map?
We can iterate the map by using entrySet() method.

86.What is the return type of entrySet?
Set<Entry<key,value>>
87.Write the methods to get the key only and value only?
For key only keySet() method is used.
For value only values() method is used.
88.What is mean by File? In which package it is available?
File is a class and it is used to achieve the file operation.
It is available in java.io package.
89.What are the methods available in File ?
mkdir();
mkdirs();
list();
createNewFile();
isDirectory();
isFile();
isHidden();
90.While creating a file if we not mention the format then under which format it will save the file?
If we do not mention the file format it will automatically take format as file.
91.What are the difference between append and updating the file?

For updating the file:
---------------------

It will replace the old contents of the file.

For appending the file:
-----------------------

It will add the contents at the end of the file.

92.What is mean by Enumerator,Iteratorand List Iterator? 

Enumeration:
--------------

It is an interface used to iterate only legacy class or interface.
Only iterates in forward direction
Iterator:
---------

It is an interface used to iterate the collection objects
Only iterates in forward direction
List Iterator:
--------------

It is an interface used for iterating list type classes
iterates in forward as well as backward direction
93.Difference between Enumurator,Iterator and List Iterator?

Enumerator:
------------

applicable only for legacy class and interface
no remove method is available.
no Backward direction is possible

Iterator:
----------

It is an Interface used to iterate the collection objects
remove method is available.
no Backward direction is possible.
ListIterator:
--------------

It is an interface used for iterating list type classes
remove method is available.
Backward direction is possible.
94.What are the methods available in Enumerator,Iteratorand List Iterator? 

Enumerator Methods:
------------------

hasMoreElements();
nextElement();

Iterator Methods:
----------------

hasNext(); 
next();
remove();

ListIterator Methods:
---------------------

hasNext(); 
next();
remove();
hasPrevious();
previous();

95.Explain JDBC connection steps?
Import JDBC packages.
Load and register the JDBC driver.
Open a connection to the database.
Create a statement object to perform a query.
Execute the statement object and return a query resultset.
Process the resultset.
Close the resultset and statement objects.
Close the connection.



96.What are control statement?
Statement which has control over the loop or program is called control statements.
Example:if,if else,for,while,dowhile etc


97.Different control statements available in java

Break:
------

It is used to terminate the loop

Continue:
----------

It is used to skip the current iteration.
while and do while

----------
While:
------

It is entry check loop.
Do While:
---------

It is a exit check loop.
if and if else
===============


if
--

executes only when the condition becomes true.

if else
--------

executes the else part when the condition becomes false and executes if part when condition becomes true.

98.Difference between immutable and mutable string
immutable and mutable string
==============================


Immutable string:
-----------------

Once created,we cant change the value in memory
In concatenation, it will create new memory
mutable string:
----------------

After creation,we can modify the value in reference(memory)
In concetanation, its takes same memory

99.Difference between Remove all() and Retain all
Remove all() and Retain all
============================


removeAll():
------------

removeAll() is a method , it is used to compare the 2 lists and remove all the common values
retainAll():
------------

retainAll() is a method, it is used to compare both lists and retains only the common values


100.Difference between Literal String and Non literal string
Literal String and Non literal string
======================================


Literal String:
---------------

In case of String duplicates,it will share the same memory address
Its stored inside the heap memory(string pool or string constant).
It share the memory if same value (duplicate value)
Non literal string:
--------------------

Even incase of String duplicates,it will have different memory address.
Itâ€™s stored in the heap memory.
Its create a new memory every time even if it is a duplicate value(same value)

101.Difference between Heap and stack memory
Heap and stack memory
=================


Heap memory:
------------

Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. 
Memory access is slow.

Static memory:
--------------

Stack is used for static memory allocation.
Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access will be very fast.

102.What is the default Package in java?
java.lang

103.What are the difference between equals() & hashcode()?

equals:
-------

Used to compare the two string.
Hashcode:
----------

Used to return the address where it stored.

104.How can we make Array list As a synchronized?
collections.SynchronisedList(refName of array);
